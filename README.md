# movie-lens-recommender
MovieLens, a movie recommendation service, provides datasets describing ratings and free-text tagging activities on their website.

I used a very small dataset and trained it on spark ALS. Next goal is to use the 20M dataset and get a more robust system.

I started using Databricks notebook server because they have Spark and Spark Streaming preconfigured. However, thier exported notebook files seem to crash github. Therefore, I am uploading the source code.
